The sidebar needs to allow for sorting, filtering, searching, and starring / unstarring. Lastly, I want to augment the github repo's metadata with a full duckdb database to provide caching, indexing, full text searching, and custom tags / labels / keywords / etc. Finally, I want this site to provide a way of syncronizing this database with a browser's bookmarks by implementing an \"export\" feature that will allow for multiple formats and export destination types (chrome, firefox, csv, awesome-list, etc). Finally, I want to provide a tRPC api for all of these features. Before implementing ANYTHING, please begin by creating a docs/design-decisions directory and an adr file for every configurable option, techs stack choice, or other decision / question you may have to execute this. For example: astro provides several options for frontend frameworks (vue, react, solid, alpine.js, svelte, etc) and also multiple options for creating the astro components and pages (markdown, mdx, frontmatter, etc). I want you to gather all of these options and create an ADR record (./docs/design-decisions/0001-your-first-question-or-config-option.md - note the lowercase, kebab-case title, preceeded by a 4-charater-long incremental ID).

Keep it simple, like vue, nuxt, or job posts that don't define a specific language, but rather describe the project and express need for someone to help architect or design or pick out the right frameworks. Can you save these requirements to a FILTER.md file. Then, can you build a cli to drive either chrome or firefox using bun as the js runtime and pm.

Let's add in these top preferred languages: Rust, JS/TS, Bash/Shell, Vue (and Nuxt), Svelte, SolidJS, alpine.js, duckdb, postgresql, sqlite, docker + linux containers + devcontainers + localstack + k8s, openapi, json-schema, a section for configuration-schema languages like Cue and Dhall, Ruby... any others you can think of?",

I used to be a Windows Sysadmin and Network Administrator as well, and got my start programming in asp classic, moved to C#, and asp.net mvc - but hate all microsoft technologies since discovering linux and the unix philosophy. ",
        "Thanks! So first and foremost, I'm a huge linux evangelist and a strong advocate and believer of the Unix Philosophy, as well as all 17 rules defined in The Art Of Unix Programming. So all things linux, containers, kernel, and shell are top of that list. That includes sysadmin stuff, linux network engineer, site reliability engineering, platform engineering, etc. Next, I've been a full stack web application engineer since 1996, and prefer Vue's incrementally adoptable approach over react's all-inclusive, exclusive, my-wayorthe-highway overly-complicated approach by far. I discovered angularJS back when it was in beta, and was instantly sold, but they unfortunately didn't learn from their mistakes of too many naming complications and dove off the deep end of complexity when they started building the Typescript flavor that we know today. I believe it's really, really hard to write something simple. I discovered Docker 2 months after it's public beta and was instantly sold as well. In fact, that's one of my best selling points (but I don't know how to phrase this): all my life I've been uncannily good at discovering, assessing, and just intuitively telling what is innovative, efficient, game-changing technology from the competition - and that includes picking the right tool for the right job (which requires both a deep understanding of the problem you're solving, as well as a deep understanding of the tools available to solve that problem... and then most importantly what a tool, technology, or language is NOT good at (those 20% edge cases that always exist and come back to haunt you because they were the wrong tool for the job and were never designed to, say, scale horizontally, for example). Doing that requires knowing what problem a language was invented to solve in the first place, and what those trade off design decisious were that were made in the beginning. Seeing that big picture, and understanding ever layer of the end-to-end puzzle, while also having deep subject matter expertise in the low level details - that's what I thrive at and am so good at and is something I haven't found in many people. I'm exceedingly good at picking up new concepts and technologies and figuring any problem out. With enough time, I can solve anything.",
        "Let's update it with a preferred tech stack, as well as some languages I avoid and dislike. I've been building web applications for 27 years (mid 90's), so the number of languages and tools and technologies I've learned and have built things in is extensive and far too vast to recall in it's entirity. I'm not sure how to format, phrase, and structure these, so I'm just going to list as many as I can recall at the moment in an unstructured format and I trust you to make it look beautiful and sound awesome (probably close to the top of the document). Sound good? Also, please ask questions and make suggestions about related tools, languages, and technologies you think may be both relevant and worth listing (without either of us going overboard by listing things like \"yaml\" - that's just rediculous and would make us look amateur, don't you agree?). Does this some ideal to you?",
        "Hey Claude, let's continue. I'd like to start with having you understand me, my skill set, experience, and cognitive stack, as this analysis will help you understand what kind of jobs and careers I excel in and want to filter for, and which ones to avoid. So let's start with having you scan the ./resume and ./resume/content folders and coalesce them into a beautifully formatted github-flavored markdown file and save it danielbodnar.md. Please be careful not to leave any details out, but go ahead and omit redundant content rewrite it so that it flows better gramatically while polishing it up so that it's pleasant and inviting to read without leaving out details.",

I'm aware of your limitations and understand them thoroughly, however im extremely technical and very very good at thinking outside of the box while also having strong opinions from ovee 3 decades of expertise, so if you dont know how to do something or cant do what i ask for then please stop, inform me, and suggest a handful of alternative approaches and wait for my further instructions.
